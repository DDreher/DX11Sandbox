# DirectX 11 Sandbox

A small collection of DirectX 11 projects I built while learning the API.

The code inside this repository was only written for learning purposes.
I never really tried to make it beautiful, easy to read, performant or 100% correct.    
In the end, all I wanted to do is to explore the API.
Now I share my code so other people doing the same may be inspired by my journey.

Tl;dr: I know the code's dirty ;) Don't judge me.

## How to build (Win64)

1. Install a `Windows SDK` if you haven't already (OS: Windows 8 or higher).
2. Run `GenerateProjectFiles.bat`.
3. Open the generated `DX11Sandbox.sln` with VS2022.
5. Build and run the desired project the desired configuration (Debug / DebugRender / Release)

## Subprojects

### [01 - Hello Triangle](01_HelloTriangle/Source/)

</p>

The very minimum to get started with a graphics API:    
A colored triangle.

### [02 - Texturing](02_TexturedCube/Source/)

<p align="left">

</p>

A rotating, textured, semi-transparent cube.    
Used to explore constant buffers, different blend states.

### [03 - Loading Models](03_Mesh/Source/)

We can now load models from files! ðŸŽ‰    
Also some further abstraction and refactoring of the render pipeline (Transforms, Shaders, Materials, Bindings,...)
